## 1.1 Evolution of Wireless (Mobile) Communications

Wireless communication has evolved dramatically since its inception, beginning with analog voice systems and now supporting high-speed data, multimedia, and internet access globally. This evolution can be categorized by generations:

- **1G**: Analog voice communication (e.g., AMPS)
- **2G**: Digital voice and limited data (e.g., GSM, CDMA)
- **2.5G**: Enhanced data services (e.g., GPRS, EDGE)
- **3G**: Higher data rates enabling video calls, mobile internet (e.g., UMTS)
- **4G**: IP-based systems with high-speed broadband (e.g., LTE)
- **5G and beyond**: Ultra-fast, low-latency networks for IoT, AR/VR, and more

**Worldwide Market Examples:**
- High smartphone penetration in countries like South Korea, the US, and Finland
- Rapid mobile growth in developing markets such as India and Africa
- Increased demand for wireless IoT devices, smart homes, and autonomous vehicles
